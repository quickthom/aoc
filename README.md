# Advent of Code
_in Python... and maybe some Julia or very maybe some Haskell or who knows what else_

This is probably not what you're looking for. I'm a non-developer doing amateur things because they are fun to me. This code may not actually run, and even if it does, I might not have bothered saving some pieces of it, because I tend to lose interest in tweaking it after getting the right answer. 

I do write code at my job, and I swear all of it is much better than this.  Well, most of it.
