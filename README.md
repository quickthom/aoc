# Advent of Code
_in Python... and maybe some Julia or very maybe some Haskell or who knows what else_

This is probably not what you're looking for. I'm an amateur doing amateur things because they are fun to me. This code may not actually run, and even if it does, I might not have bothered saving some pieces of it, because I tend to lose interest in tweaking it after getting the right answer. 

Thank God the internet will save it forever!
